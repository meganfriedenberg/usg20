                            <h2>ALEXIS AREIAS / LUCY WARREN
                            </h2>
                            <p>For Alexis Areias and Lucy Warren, rebuilding trust in Undergraduate Student Government is essential.<br><br> “If  we’ve  seen  anything  in  the  last  year,  it’s  just  how much [trust] has dwindled,” said Areias, a junior majoring in political science. “And how little students can feel confident in this organization and that they’re being properly represented.” Areias and Warren, who currently serve as senator and  chief  diversity  officer  for  USG  respectively,  aim  to  collaborate  with  groups  outside  of  USG  to  tackle  financial barriers and accessibility issues.<br><br>
                            “We  really  believe  that  making  this  culture  shift  come  to  fruition  within  the  organization  happens  by  centering  all  of  our  work  off  of  the  student  advocacy  that’s   already   being   done   on   this   campus,   and   recognizing what their demands are, and just how we can  best  support  and  amplify  them,”  said  Warren,  a  junior majoring in economics.<br><br> 
                            The  Alexis  &  Lucy  ticket  worked  together  last  semester   on   a   free   menstrual   product   initiative   and   the   pass/no   pass   resolution.   If   elected,   the   ticket  plans  to  create  a  cultural  space  for  disabled  students  on  campus  and  improve  the  visibility  of  Disability  Services  and  Programs.  They  also  want  to  ban  all  single-use  plastic  items  and  expand  existing  composting efforts.

                             <h2>ALEXANDRA GILL / DEL WOOD
                             </h2>

                             <p>
                                Both  first-year  transfer  students,  Alexandra  Gill  and  Del   Wood   have   never   served   in   USC   Undergraduate   Student Government before, but aim to use their platform to help “students feel safe on campus.”
                                <br><br>
                                Gill, who described dealing with campus police on her previous  college  campus,  does  not  want  to  abolish  the  Department  of  Public  Safety  but  rather  provide  officers  tools   including   trauma-informed   training   to   better   serve  students  through  problems.  Their  campaign  also  announced a plan to allow students to carry pepper spray and  tasers  on  campus  to  “protect  themselves.”  Their  platform  does  not  stipulate  whether  the  candidates  have  taken into account the various legal restrictions for the use of such weapons in California.<br><br>
                                “USC  is  kind  of  a  bubble,  and  we  want  to  integrate  it  into  the  outside  community,”  said  Wood,  a  sophomore  majoring  in  international  relations  with  an  emphasis  on  global  business.  “We  don’t  want  to  be  this  segregated  bubble and that will help with a lot of our crime issues.”<br><br>
                                Gill, a junior  majoring  in  business  administration,  and  Wood  also  highlighted  plans  to  bring  back  campus  spots  such  as  Ground  Zero  and  provide  a  proper  “Trojan  experience”  to  this  year’s  freshman  and  transfers  once  students return to campus.<br><br>
                                “The two other slates we’re running against, obviously, have  both  served  in  USG  before,  but  I  don’t  actively  see  them telling us what they’ve accomplished,” Gill said. “We want to enact action, rather than just promising it.”

                            </h2>
                            <p>Shreya Chaudhary and Antonio Okeke want you to expect more.<br><br>
                                
                            “We’re not going to continue the USG of exclusivity,” said Okeke, a transfer student majoring in public policy and on the pre-law track originally from South Sudan. “Especially with what happened last year and what has been happening for decades, we’re trying to change that image.” <br><br>

                            A key factor for the Shreya & Antonio ticket is instituting a tuition freeze.
                            Chaudhary, a junior majoring in business administration who is the chief communications officer of Undergraduate Student Government, is confident she can work with the administration to improve affordability.For  Chaudhary,  this  issue  is  personal.  Her  mother  was  diagnosed with cancer while she was in high school; she took on heavy financial burdens to attend USC.<br><br>

                            “No   student   should   have   to   make   that   sacrifice,”   Chaudhary  said.  “We  want  to  establish  a  student  advisory committee [where students] from various socioeconomic backgrounds inform [the] decisions the administration makes.”<br><br>

                            Okeke  understands  the  past  of  brushing  diversity  and  inclusion under the rug and wants USG to be a safe space for all students.<br><br>

                            “It’s revealing that it’s your student government,” Okeke said. “At the end of the day, we are both in student government  because  we’re  trying  to  do  one  thing:  make  USG  a  better place for everybody.”

                <h3>DAILY TROJAN SPRING 2021 EDITORIAL BOARD</h3>

      <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he  role  of  Undergraduate  Student  Government   president   and   vice   president   is   no   small   task,   demanding an authentic desire and willing-ness to serve the USC student body with transparency,  accountability  and  the  utmost respect for the community they represent. <br><br> 
    Following  the  tumultuous  onslaught  of  controversy  in  USG  brought  to  light  this  past  year  —  which  led  to  the  early  resignation  of  former  President  Truman  Fritz   and   Vice   President   Rose   Ritch   —  it  is  all  the  more  critical  that  USG’s  upcoming  leadership  is  equipped  with  equitable policies that lead the University forward  and  have  character  and  ethical  agendas  that  are  demonstrative  of  the  values   held   within   our   student   body.   For  these  reasons,  the  Daily  Trojan  has  decided to endorse presidential candidate Shreya  Chaudhary  and  vice  presidential  candidate Antonio Okeke.<br><br>
    In  regards  to  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion, the Shreya & Antonio ticket had much  to  contribute,  seeking  to  expand  upon already existing propositions of diversity  and  inclusion,  while  also  offering  new  ideas.  They  aim  to  shorten  the  length of the USG application to make it more accessible to students, emphasizing the importance of diversity initiatives in both  staff  and  student  pools  and  the  necessity for establishing mandatory diversity trainings for the campus.<br><br>
    When      asked      about      Black      and      Palestinian  students,  Shreya  &  Antonio  spoke  directly  about  expanding  physical  spaces  on  campus  for  these  communities.  They  voiced  their  desire  to  incorporate a Manasseh student group within USG. Additionally, they spoke about their support  for  the  Black  House  proposition  from 2015. <br><br>
    The  Alexis  Areias  and  Lucy  Warren  ticket  also  supported  the  implementation of the Black House, similarly emphasizing  their  overall  desire  to  build  upon  existing   channels   for   diversity,   equity   and inclusion.<br><br>
    Overall,   the   Shreya   &   Antonio   and   Alexis  &  Lucy  tickets  presented  a  striking contrast between their DEI initiatives and  those  of  candidates  Alexandra  Gill  and  Dell  Wood.  When  asked  about  addressing such issues on campus, Gill and Wood  mentioned  their  desire  to  support  Greek  life  organizations  and  their  ongoing  DEI  efforts,  stating  they  would  also  like to help them with socioeconomic diversity  by  “giving  them  some  money  to  ease the barrier to entry financially.”<br><br> Regarding        security        and        the        Department  of  Public  Safety,  the  platforms  hold  starkly  contrasting  agendas.  The  Alexandra  &  Dell  ticket  posits  DPS  as  a  “very  misunderstood  organization”  and  opposes  defunding  it  because  “that  is   not   practical   while   living   in   South   Central  L.A.”  Instead,  they  propose  that  students  should  be  allowed  to  shadow  DPS  to  establish  transparency  and  uphold  accountability  within  the  organization.  The  Alexandra  &  Dell  ticket  also  proposes that students should be able to possess  non-lethal  weapons  such  as  tasers on campus.<br><br>
    The Daily   Trojan   acknowledges   the   discrimination    experienced    by    Black    and  Indigenous  students  and  students  of  color  and  community  members  that  necessitates  an  anti-racist  approach  to  public  safety.  Because  we  believe  that  the  Alexandra  &  Dell  platform  supports  policies  that  could  potentially  threaten  the  USC  and  South  Central  community,  where Black and Latinx students and other  community  members  experience  racial profiling and violence at the hands of DPS, we instead support the public safety  agendas  of  the  Shreya  &  Antonio  and  Alexis & Lucy tickets, which call for providing  DPS  with  the  training  to  become  better  allies  to  the  community  and  radical  change  within  the  organization, respectively.<br><br>
   
   </p>
    <blockquote>The inevitability of the unpredictable is why trust in the judgment and character of whoever is elected is of the utmost importance. In this regard, the Chaudhary and Okeke duo offer what feels like true sincerity and humility.<br><br><h4>DAILY TROJAN SPRING 2021 EDITORIAL BOARD</h4></blockquote><p>


            There is a clear need at USC to improve resources  for  international  students  and  help  them  adapt  to  student  life  in  the  United  States  —  especially  during  the  coronavirus  pandemic.  All  three  tickets  are  adamant  about  bolstering  funding for  the  Office  of  International  Services  and expanding the office, but the Shreya &  Antonio  ticket  is  the  only  one  with  a  solid, tangible action plan that can serve international students from day one.<br><br>
            Their   platform   includes   a   roadmap   to  make  USC  easier  to  navigate  for  the  University’s large number of international  students.  Integral  to  their  plan  is  developing  an  international  student  peer  mentorship  program  which  will  help  acclimate  international  students  to  USC.  Additionally,   the   candidates’   plan   to   partner  with  the  University’s  Office  of  International  Services  in  order  to  grow  this  program  and  provide  official  training for mentors.<br><br>
            Shreya  &  Antonio  are  also  passionate  about  helping  students  avoid  a  situation  in  which  they  would  have  to  choose  between  their  mental  health  and  their  education.  While  all  three  tickets  recognized the need to improve and expand on mental  health  resources  at  USC,  Shreya  & Antonio set themselves apart from the other candidates through concrete steps.<br><br>
            Specifically,  their  ticket  proposes  re-instating  doctor’s  notes  from  Engemenn  health  professionals,  allowing  students  to  take  time  to  prioritize  their  physical  and  mental  health  without  being  penalized for it academically. In addition, they aim to expand and diversify the counseling services and staff at Engemann — in alignment with their platform-wide goals to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion.<br><br>
            Shreya & Antonio also propose an extension  of  Engemann’s  hours  of  operation  during  testing  seasons,  mentioning  that  mental  health  is  not  only  an  issue for students in the specific time block during   which   Engemann   offers   counseling services. In   an   interview   with   the Daily  Trojan  Editorial  Board,  Okeke  also mentioned their hopes to work with Engemann and their financial managers, to  ensure  students  have  access  to their services 24/7. <br><br>
            Their platform also addresses the need to expand mental health services to students who are currently living outside of California. Shreya & Antonio plan to take a  look  at  policies  that  prevent  USC  from  serving  out-of-state  students.  Alexandra  &  Dell  also  emphasized  the  need  for  accessibility to mental health resources.<br><br>
            On the issue of campus and community  sustainability,  the  Areias  and  Warren  and   Chaudhary   and   Okeke   platforms   contributed  substantive  action  plans  to  create  change  within  current  University  practices.  In  support  of  DivestSC, both tickets called for the selling of University investments in the fossil fuel industry, totaling to a staggering $277 million. Both tickets  also  endorsed  the  ban  of  single-use   plastics   campus-wide,   and   shared   a  commitment  to  creating  a  commuter  program to reduce student carbon emissions. <br><br>
            In   looking   at   current   campus   sustainability  measures,  the  Chaudhary  &  Okeke  ticket  acknowledges  the  benefits  of the University’s long term sustainability plan, but aims to create more policies that  are  responsive  to  campus  pollution  happening now. This includes the implementation  of  a  carbon  emissions  offset  program, taking into account University-sponsored travel and creating a program to invest an amount equivalent into community sustainability efforts.<br><br>
            In   speaking   of   their   plans   to   work   closely with the Garden Club, Chaudhary and   Okeke   emphasized   their   commitment   to   mobilizing   USC   and   its   surrounding   community   to   create   more   green  spaces  around  campus,  aiming  to  reach better practices in sustainability in the coming year and beyond.<br><br>
            Ultimately,   unanticipated   issues   are   bound to face whoever wins the election. The  inevitability  of  the  unpredictable  is  why trust in the judgment and character of whoever is elected is of the utmost importance.  In  this  regard,  the  Chaudhary  and  Okeke  duo  offer  what  feels  like  true  sincerity    and    humility,    according    to    their virtual endorsement video with the editorial board. <br><br>
            They  understand  their  role  as  one  to  serve  the  community  they  are  in,  which  was  made  clear  by  Chaudhary’s  introduction  of  their  ticket  in  the  Feb.  4  virtual debate. Chaudhary began by offering a month by month breakdown of her and Okeke’s  action  plan.  By  contrast,  Gill  introduced  their  ticket  with  an  emphasis  on  her  and  her  running  mate’s  status  as  “outsiders,”  demanding  an  end  to  career  politicians.<br><br> Moreover,   throughout   the   course   of   the  debate,  some  unbecoming  personal  attacks  were  levied,  however  Chaudhary  and   Okeke   positioned   themselves   the   least of the frivolous crossfire. Meanwhile, candidates Gill and Areias went back and forth  about  the  extent  of  their  personal  involvement  in  Greek  life,  among  other  things.  Chaudhary  and  Okeke’s  behavior  over  the  course  of  the  undoubtedly  tumultuous  and  sometimes-derailed  debate  showcases  their  focus  and  genuine  commitment to issues of substance. <br><br> On  a  final  note,  over  the  course  of  the  endorsement  interviews  conducted  by  the  Daily  Trojan  with  all  candidates,  Chaudhary  and  Okeke  offered  by  far  the  most   straightforward   answers   to   our   questions.  While  platitudes  and  rhetorical fluff are always to be expected in politics,  they  were  notably  absent  from  the  duo’s responses. For lack of a better term, they stuck to the real stuff. <br><br> While    the    Daily    Trojan    has    officially  made  their  endorsement  for  the  Chaudhary  &  Okeke  ticket,  it  remains  clear  that  the  endorsement  is  not  made  in perpetuity. Our endorsement is reliant upon candidate interviews and an analysis of their public platforms and debates, which  in  no  part  serve  to  represent  the  actions,  decisions  and  behaviors  of  candidates  if  they  are  to  assume  office.  The  Daily  Trojan  pledges  to  continue  holding University leaders accountable for the problems   and   shortcomings   they   seek   to  tackle  and  the  ones  they  may  create  themselves. <br><br> While  we  have  defended  our  endorsement  with  research  and  assessment  of  what we believe to be the best fit for student  leadership,  we  call  upon  the  student body to conduct their own research, and to critically engage and question the candidates  on  their  platforms  as  well.  Undergraduate student leaders are elected  to  represent  the  interests,  values  and  needs of students, in which they can only be  held  accountable  through  the  votes  and participation of students in the election  process.  We  are  grateful  to  student  activists who have demonstrated the importance  of  calling  out  our  elected  leaders  when  they  have  failed  to  uphold  the  interests  of  our  community,  and  encourage  all  students  to  thoughtfully  take  inspiration  from  their  work  as  we  elect  USC’s  next  cohort  of  undergraduate  student leaders. <br><br>
