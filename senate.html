							<h2> Ruben Romeo & Arie Abija</h2>
						</div>

						Arie  Abija  and  Ruben  Romeo  are  running  on  a  platform  centered  around  the  international  student  community, global issues and action-based change. 
						<br>
						<br> “Not   every   international   student   has   the   same   background,” said Romeo, a senior majoring in health promotion  and  disease  prevention  who  is  also  the  speaker  of  the  senate.  “You  can’t  assume  anyone’s  story  ...  so  getting  to  be  friends  with  and  learning  [from] international students’ stories ... has shown us the grievances that they’ve had to fight alone.”
						<br>
						<br>  When asked about what made her passionate about community  organization,  Abija,  a  junior  majoring  in  theatre  with  an  emphasis  on  acting,  explained  that she wanted to see “what aligned with [her] backbone as a person.” Through the arts, she said she’d been able to  be  involved  with  the  community  and  people,  but  with USG, she could further that mission.
						<br>
						<br>They’ve both educated themselves on global current events  and  have  been  working  to  support  Armenian  students  during  the  ongoing  violence  and  oppression  Armenia  was  facing  from  Azerbaijan  and  to  write  statements denouncing SARS in Nigeria. Abija,  who  serves  as  the  aide  to  the  speaker  of  the  senate,  emphasizes  the  importance  of  making  USG  accessible to all students and further integrating into all communities present on campus.
						<br>
						<br> “At   the   end   of   the   day,   student   government   is   supposed to serve the students,” Abija said.

						</div>

						Brian   Stowe   aims   to   increase   transparency,   improve  mental  health  services  and  establish  a  more diverse student assembly. 
						<br>
						<br> Stowe,   a   junior   majoring   in   industrial   and   systems  engineering,  emphasizes  teamwork  and  clear communication to create policies that can be passed. 
						<br>
						<br> Stowe,  who  is  a  cadet  in  USC’s  Air  Force  ROTC  program, believes he has the leadership experience to rebuild a student government that represents all students. 
						<br>
						<br>“I’m  not  in  this  for  personal  gain,”  Stowe  said.  “That  separates  me  from  everyone,  by  tenfold  or  more, because I’m not doing this to put something on my resume.” Stowe said he plans on tackling difficult topics head on. 
						<br>
						<br> “We  have  issues  of  injustice,  we  have  issues  of  insensitivity  and  a  lot  of  these  aren’t  nice  issues,”  Stowe  said.  “You’re  not  going  to  be  able  to  attack  these issues by being nice or sugar coating things. I guarantee you that I’m the most straightforward person on this ticket. I do not say anything in a way that’s going to make it seem different than it is.”

							<h2>Tommy Nguyen & Kevin Gutierrez</h2>
						</div>

						Kevin  Gutierrez  and  Tommy  Nguyen  were  each  other’s   first   friends   at   USC.   They   are   running   together  on  a  platform  of  advocacy  for  Black  and  Indigenous students and students of color, as well as mental health awareness. 
						<br>
						<br> An important aspect of their agenda is critically examining   the   relationship   the Department of Public Safety has   with   the   community and students of color. 
						<br>
						<br> “If  that  means  divesting  from  the  DPS  ...  then  that  will  be  our  action,”  said  Nguyen,  a  junior  majoring in history.
						<br>
						<br>Nyguen said that his and Gutierrez’s experiences as orientation advisors gave them the opportunity to  know  what  works  at  USC  and  what  doesn’t.  In  addition,  Gutierrez  is  a  seasoned  Undergraduate  Student  Government  member  serving  in  the  past  as a Senate aide and more recently as a senator. Maintaining  student  mental  health  is  another  top concern for the pair. 
						<br>
						<br> “With  the  stress  of  college  and  life  magnified  with    [the    coronavirus]    and    online    learning,”    Nguyen said. “Our priority lies in the wellbeing of our  students  against  discrimination  and  mental  illness.”

							<h2> Devin Ayala</h2>
						</div>

						Devin Ayala is running for Undergraduate Student Government Senate on the basis of collaboration.
						<br>
						<br> “I  wanted  to  really  get  a  grasp  of  what  clubs  and  organizations  want  on  campus,”  said  Ayala,  a  freshman  majoring  in  environmental  science  and  health “One of the biggest platform points is bridging the gap between clubs and organizations and USG.”
						<br>
						<br> He said he intends to rebuild the foundation of the USC community. Unafraid to address the disconnect between  the  student  body  and  USG,  Ayala  insists  that to effectively advocate for the changes students demand,  such  as  increased  funding  towards  mental  health  initiatives  and  further  discussion  regarding  the  controversial  tuition  spike.  USG  must  first  re-establish  communication  and  trust  with  students.  Ayala said he plans to do this through collaboration, by establishing designated groups within USG which would be in contact with clubs and organizations on campus.
						<br>
						<br>Other  pillars  of  Ayala’s  platform  include  mental  health    advocacy    on    campus    and    focusing    on    community  outreach  in  the  Los  Angeles  area.  Ayala  hopes to combat the low-income barrier by equipping more first generation students to apply to colleges of their choosing. He said the first step, however, will be to rebuild the campus community and ensure USG’s attention to students’ needs.

							<h2>Matthew Ayala & Hana Li
							</h2>
						</div>

						With   a   campaign   rooted   in   the   efforts   and   diverse  perspectives  of  their  team,  Matthew  Ayala  and  Hana  Li  want  to  meaningfully  address  long-held concerns of equity on campus and create more transparency  between  the  Undergraduate  Student  Government and USC’s student body.
						<br>
						<br> “I  think  that  something  that  Hana  and  I  believe  in is ’diversity’ and ‘inclusion’ should be more than just  buzzwords,”  said  Ayala,  a  junior  majoring  in  political science. “We want to make sure that we’re focusing on accountability and transparency within the recognized student organization community.”
						<br>
						<br> With their experiences in different organizations across    campus    and    mutual    determination    to    address deep rooted issues at USC, Ayala and Li said they are looking to advocate for all student groups and expand cultural centres on campus.
						<br>
						<br>“We  want  to  bring  the  decision  making  back  to  the  student  body  and  make  sure  that  students  are  comfortable   approaching   us   with   concerns   that   they  do  have,”  said  Li,  a  sophomore  majoring  in  business  administration  who  currently  serves  as  a  USG  Senate  aide.  “We  actually  encourage  them  to  challenge us if our platform isn’t what it should be.”

							<h2>Diego Andrades
							</h2>
						</div>

						As  a  first-generation  student,  Diego  Andrades  under-stands  the  importance  of  self-advocacy  and  hopes  to  use  his  voice  to  benefit  the  entire  USC  student  body.  For  this reason, Andrades, a sophomore majoring in politics, philosophy  and  law  and  political  science,  has  structured  his  platform  around  the  theme:  making  a  healthier  and  more equitable USC.
						<br>
						<br>“Inequities  in  terms  of  wealth,  I  think,  is  a  really  big  problem  ...  There’s  a  very  large  wealth  gap  between  the  bottom and top of USC,” Andrades said. 
						<br>
						<br> Diego  directly  serves  as  an  elected  Undergraduate  Student  Government  Senate  aide.  His  platform  is  also influenced  by  what  he  has  learned  as  a  current  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  officer  in  the  Phi  Alpha  Delta  law  fraternity.   
						<br>
						<br> He  said  he  believes  that  students  should  have  more  say  in  the  University’s  crucial  decisions.  Among  several platform points, Andrades is strongly advocating for more  sources  provided  to  transfer  and  undocumented  students. 
						<br>
						<br> Currently, only 20-30% of the USC student body votes for their USC USG. Andrades emphasized the importance of voting to see changes within USG.
						<br>
						<br>“We  need  to  make  sure  that  the  USC  student  body  is  aware  of  what’s  going  on  in  USC  and  has  that  transparency,” Andrades said. “And they would want to vote when they have the ability to see what’s going on.”

							<h2> Nicholas Yang & Henry Parker-Elder
							</h2>
						</div>

						Henry  Parker-Elder  and  Nick  Yang  are  committed  to  promoting  mental  health  and  wellness  as  USC  students  remain isolated.
						<br>
						<br> The  freshmen’s  leadership  experience  began  in  high  school,  where  they  met  in  class.  Parker-Elder,  a  theatre  major,  served  as  his  high  school’s  senior  class  president.  Yang,   who’s   majoring   in   business,   served   in   USC’s   Undergraduate Student Government as a Senate aide. 
						<br>
						<br>They  developed  concern  for  their  classmates’  after  conducting mental health check-ins during Zoom courses.
						<br>
						<br> “I  would  try  to  ask  in  every  breakout  room,  ‘  How  are  you  feeling? ’”  Parker-Elder  said.  “A  lot  of  the  responses  I  got from freshmen were that they weren’t feeling great.” 
						<br>
						<br> heir   most   prominent   mental   health   initiative   is   the  distribution  of  what  they  are  calling  a  COVID  care  package, which consists of blue light glasses, infographics on redlight filters and USC dining recipes.
						<br>
						<br> Yang   shared,   however,   that   their   greatest   priority   is  enacting  mandatory  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  workshops to “combat racism on campus.”
						<br>
						<br> Yang  and  Parker-Elder  believe  “lack  of  trust”  with  the  public  is  USG’s  largest  issue.  Yang  alluded  to  USG-related   posts   on   the   @black_at_usc   Instagram   page   while describing his concerns with the organization. Both students agree initiatives towards inclusion are something they will promote no matter the outcome of their election.

							<h2>Hunter Hinson
							</h2>
						</div>

						Hunter  Hinson,  who  is  a  Pell  Grant  recipient,  plans  to  reduce  financial  barriers  for  students  at  USC  if  elected  to  the  Undergraduate  Student  Government  Senate.  Among  Hinson’s  specific  policy  plans  are  textbook  aid  support,  expanding  the  Trojan  Food  Pantry  and  creating  a  history  fund  so  students  can  research  and  confront  USC’s  past,  particularly its role as a predominantly white institution.
						<br>
						<br> Hinson,  a  sophomore  majoring  in  political  science  and  communication,  currently  serves  as  the  executive  aide  to  USG’s chief of staff. He believes this experience equips him to make his ideas a reality.
						<br>
						<br> “Having  that  knowledge  of  what  it  actually  takes  for  USG  to  implement  reform  or  pressure  the  administration  to make the changes that students want, I think would be super helpful as a senator,” Hinson said. “Then, if I want to implement different reforms ... I know what those conversations already have looked like in the past.”
						<br>
						<br> Hinson   also   said   he   hopes   to   implement   internal   reforms  to  USG  to  combat  toxicity  and  re-establish  trust  between USG and the USC student body.
						<br>
						<br> “[Students]  think  [USG  is]  not  really  necessary,  or  they  think  it  doesn’t  really  represent  them,”  Hinson  said.  “Or  it’s  just  something  that  makes  scandals,  which  definitely  shouldn’t be the case. It should be something that students really like, and they feel as if it’s something that’s helpful.”

							<h2> Russell Agustin & Nivea Krishnan
							</h2>
						</div>

						Russell Agustin and Nivea Krishnan, two senato-rial candidates majoring in public policy, have a lot more in common than just their major.  Both fresh-men realized their visions for a better USC aligned.
						<br>
						<br> “We found that we had a lot of things in common ... the biggest thing is our belief in student agency,” said  Agustin,  who  currently  serves  as  an  executive  aide   to   the   Undergraduate   Student   Government   president.  “Ultimately,  that’s  how  we  make  change,  we  get  people  involved  and  we  don’t  exclude  anyone.” 
						<br>
						<br> Agustin   and   Krishnan   believe   they   can   enact  real  change  with  “ACT,”  their  platform’s  motto  that  stands for Accountability, Community and Turnout. 
						<br>
						<br> “My  main  priority  with  USG  is  making  sure  that  every  Trojan  feels  like  they  have  a  voice,  and  that  voice  is  actually  amplified  and  acknowledged  by  administration,”  said  Krishnan,  who  sits  on  USG’s  Affordability  and  Basic  Needs  committee.  “I  think  that is the biggest thing lacking right now.” 
						<br>
						<br>Agustin  and  Krishnan  will  reform  campus  by  encouraging students to speak out, but also by elim-inating   problematic   memorializations   of   known   eugenicists and creating transparency.
						<br>
						<br>“We think that all USC students should be aware and keep tabs on what’s going around in their community, so they can support it,” said Krishnan.
